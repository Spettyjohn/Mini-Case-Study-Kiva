# Mini-Case-Study-Kiva
This is a mini case study for Kiva Microlending Act 4

## Background
P2P micro lending platform specializing in low minimum for loan contributions focusing on high social impact.
Competitors include Pave, Lending Club and Upstart, though they have much higher loan minimum around $1000 and up instead of 25.

## Technology
Kiva uses a peer to peer market place for users to contribute to the loan.
They are considered a fintech company because they incorporate several key features like p2p lending combined with low dollar amounts allows for a bigger pool of potential lenders and ability to spread more risk.

## Strengths
Kiva is an online platform that allows it to reach a large number of users. It targets low income entrepreurs, farmers and students with smaller loans which are usually easier to repay. 
The platforms loan repayment rate is 97% (self-reported on their website). This low default rate, combined with low increments for borrowing allows it to attract a large pool of borrowers.
Currently operating in 82 countries, with 1.6 million lenders and 2.3 million borrowers. 

## Weaknesses
Kiva takes no fee from the loans its platform issues. This makes the company vulnerable to decreases in donations or grants. Fraudulent loans and questionable field partners have tarnished the companies reputation. 
Lack of transparency regarding money flow has hurt the companies reputation further. 

## Prognosis
As people push for more transparency with their donations, Kiva's past blunders may hurt their future chances. Although they have a very large pool of users, and have made efforts to correct elemenets related to their transparency, it is likely that they will not adapt well enough to hold their position against new competitors.
